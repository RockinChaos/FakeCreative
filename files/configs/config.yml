Preferences:
  auto-restore: true # if creative mode should automatically be restored on server restart or HARD reload...
  fly-speed: 1.0 # the creative flight speed.
  allow-flight: true # if the creative player can fly.
  invulnerable: true # if the creative player is damagable.
  invulnerable-delay: 5 # how long the player should be invulnerable after EXITING creative. (in seconds)
  unbreakable-items: true # if items should take durability damage in creative.
  health: 20 # health points of a player relative to heart-scale.
  heart-scale: 1.0 # number of hearts of a creative player.
  food-level: 20 # food level of a creative player.
  hunger-depletion: false # if the player should use their hunger bar while in creative, setting to false maintains the defined food-level until creative is exited.
  allow-fire: false # if the player should catch fire. If you have invulnerable set to true and you set this to false it essentially prevents a very lengthy fire animation on the screen. (Prevents the annoying animation when using a notch apple or fire resistance potion and jumping into the lava.)
  block-drops: false # if blocks should drop when breaking blocks.
  sword-block: true # if sword items should be BLOCKED from breaking blocks.
  break-speed: 4.0 # total number of ticks to wait before allowing the player to break the next block. Tweaking this changes the speed at which you can destroy items (via left-click) in creative.
  store-inventory: true # acts like Multiverse-Inventories so that once you enter creative your items are cleared and once you exit creative your items get restored.
