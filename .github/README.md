## FakeCreative - Creative Mode Emulation.
-----

### Description
-----
```
Coming Soon...
```
-----
### Installation
```
1) Once the FakeCreative.jar is downloaded, the jar must be placed into your server's plugins folder.
2) Double-check the server's plugins folder for any duplicate FakeCreative.jar files, such as FakeCreative(1).jar.
3) Delete any found duplicate instances or there will be conflicting errors in the console window.
4) Once this is completed, the server must be restarted to register and enable the plugin. The plugin
   will then attempt to find your server version and generate a configuration based on the found version.
5) From this point, it is up to you to configure the plugin or join the discord for additional help.
```
